# DinosaurGame
My dinosaur survival game which I've been working on for the past year, I worked on this game for 8 months and the plan is to keep working on it until the end of the summer and in the end of the summer the game should be complete, of course after the game is complete I will keep working on it and publish it only when I feel like the game is in a finished state.
